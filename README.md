# Connamara-Project
Organic Chemistry translation program. Written in Ruby for Connamara Interview Process.

- Accept as input: the name of a compound in Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) format
- Then, give as output: the name of that compound in IUPAC Nomenclature
- You only need to correctly handle alkanes (simple hydrocarbons), which will greatly reduce the scope and complexity
- You only need to handle straight-chain and branched alkanes, i.e. no cyclics
- The interface to the application is not important (std in/out)
- Implement it in Ruby
- Include tests (rspec, testunit, or whatever you prefer)
